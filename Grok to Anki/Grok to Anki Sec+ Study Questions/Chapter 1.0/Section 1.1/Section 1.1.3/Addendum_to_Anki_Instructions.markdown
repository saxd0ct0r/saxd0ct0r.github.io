# Addendum to Anki Instructions

This addendum provides guidance to supplement the rules in `anki-instructions.txt` for creating Anki-compatible study questions for any subject area, based on iterative feedback and refinements. Version 4 integrates original statements with consolidated statements (September 23, 2025). Version 5 incorporates feedback from question generation for Section 1.1.3 (October 14, 2025), consolidating statements to reduce redundancy and replacing original statements 1, 6, 8, 11, 14–16, 19, and 25 with refined versions (32, 36–38).

2. **Avoid Course-Specific Terms in Questions**: Ensure question text excludes course-specific terms (e.g., specific course names or tools) for reusability, including them only in metadata or explanations, unless they are general subject concepts.
3. **Multiple-Cloze Formats**: Use multiple-cloze structures with part-of-speech hints (e.g., {{c1::term::verb}}) for complex phrases to enhance granular recall.
4. **Structured Formatting for Questions**: Ensure tags include Section::X.X.X, topic, question type (e.g., cloze), and instance number for Multiple Choice (MC) questions (e.g., instance-1), with “multiple-correct” for multiple-correct MC questions; assign letter identifiers (A, B, C, D) to match randomized option order in MC “Options” and “OptionsWithCorrect” columns.
5. **Cross-Reference Prior Conversations**: Check prior conversations, not just previous sections, for duplication, particularly for recurring terms.
7. **Uniform Question Phrasing for MC Instances**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) questions for a topic use identical phrasing across instances, varying only QID and options, to prevent phrasing-based cues; use plural phrasing (e.g., “Which are…?”) for multiple-correct questions and singular (e.g., “Which is…?”) for single-correct questions.
9. **Robust Non-Circular MC Explanations**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) explanations are robust, avoid circular reasoning, and detail why correct and incorrect options apply, referencing their relevance to the subject.
10. **Consistent Form for MC Distractors**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) distractors match the form (single-word or phrase-length) and number (singular, plural, collective) of correct options, shaping correct options to short phrases if single-word distractors are implausible, while being subject-relevant and plausible without overlapping correct answers.
12. **Consistent MC Terminology**: Ensure consistent terminology for concepts across Multiple Choice (MC) instances to avoid confusion.
13. **Consistent MC Terminology**: Ensure consistent terminology for concepts across Multiple Choice (MC) instances to avoid confusion.
17. **Focus on Core Subject Concepts**: Generate questions only for explicitly stated concepts in the source text. Exclude content related to pedagogical goals, such as learning objectives, course structure, or statements about building foundational knowledge.
18. **Avoid Future Learning Statements**: Do not derive questions from statements about what learners will do or achieve in the future (e.g., "In this module, you will..."). Focus exclusively on concepts currently explained in the text to avoid speculative or procedural content.
20. **Simplify Question Phrasing**: Remove superfluous phrases from questions to enhance conciseness and clarity, adhering to the minimum information principle. Ensure the question remains focused on the core fact or concept without extraneous context.
21. **Present MC Instances Together**: When reviewing Multiple Choice (MC) questions, present all instances of a given question (e.g., instance-1, instance-2) simultaneously for side-by-side comparison to allow evaluation of consistency in phrasing, distractor quality, and correct answer positioning.
22. **Prioritize Atomic and Explicit Facts**: Questions must target atomic facts explicitly stated in the text. Avoid inferring or expanding beyond the provided content, especially for abstract or pedagogical statements.
23. **Atomic SA Answers and Scenario-Based Questions**: Ensure Simple Answer (SA) answers focus on a single atomic fact. If an answer is complex, split it into separate SA questions or simplify to the most essential fact, moving details to Cloze Deletion (CD) or Multiple Choice (MC) questions, using standard subject principles for simplification if the source is vague. For concepts requiring differentiation or application, create at least two scenario-based SA questions per concept in the format: “This is a scenario. [Question about concept or category]?”, ensuring scenarios are distinct and non-redundant.
24. **Non-Circular Questions and Explanations**: Ensure questions and MC explanations avoid circular reasoning. Use practical scenarios to imply concepts without restating answers. MC explanations must be robust, non-circular, and clarify why distractors are plausible but incorrect, referencing their subject relevance.
26. **Multiple Choice Question Design**: Create a sufficient number of Multiple Choice (MC) question instances to prevent learners from memorizing correct answer positions, relying instead on factual content, while balancing against increased review burden. Use three instances for simpler concepts and four for complex or key concepts (e.g., foundational or central topics in the subject). Vary the number of correct options: one correct out of four options (most common), two correct out of five (less frequent), and three correct out of seven (rarest, reserved for triadic concepts). For correct answer position randomization and distractor design, adhere to Consolidated Statement 36. Use identical phrasing across instances, varying only the QID and options. Use singular phrasing (e.g., “What is…?”) for single-correct questions and plural phrasing (e.g., “Which are…?”) with “(CHOOSE X)” for multi-correct questions, where X matches the number of correct answers.
27. **Strategic Redundancy and Format Consistency**: Reinforce key concepts across SA, CD, and MC formats (e.g., SA for definition, CD for term, MC for scenarios) without near-identical content. Ensure MC questions use consistent phrasing across instances, with plural phrasing for multiple-correct questions (e.g., “Which are…?” with “(CHOOSE X)”) and singular for single-correct (e.g., “What is…?”), aligning the CHOOSE prompt with the number of correct answers.
28. **Context Cues and Clarity**: Include a subject-specific context cue (e.g., “[Subject]”) in CD Text fields and SA/MC Front/Question fields to prime recall, avoiding extraneous phrases. Ensure clean text by preventing formatting errors and verify CSV fields for proper escaping of commas, pipes, and HTML tags.
29. **Handling Missing Source Details**: For topics not explicitly detailed in the source text, use standard subject definitions or principles to derive atomic, explicit questions aligned with learning outcomes or key terms.
30. **File Naming and Section Specificity**: Name CSV files by section (e.g., SA-X-X-X.csv, CD-X-X-X.csv, MC-X-X-X.csv), including only questions tagged with the relevant section (e.g., Section::X.X.X).
31. **Present MC Instances Together**: Present all MC instances together during review for comparison of phrasing, distractor quality, and correct answer positioning.
32. **Atomic and Scenario-Based SA Questions**: Ensure Simple Answer (SA) questions target a single atomic fact, splitting multi-concept answers into separate questions (e.g., "Create and test" into two questions). For concepts requiring differentiation, create at least two scenario-based SA questions per concept in the format "[Scenario]. What type/category is this?" using distinct, non-obvious scenarios to enhance engagement and nuanced understanding.
33. **Consistent Terminology**: Use consistent terminology for classifications (e.g., categories vs. types), specifying primary categories or types to indicate hierarchy and avoid confusion with secondary concepts.
34. **Avoid Redundant Wording**: Ensure question phrasing avoids repeating key answer terms unless necessary, rephrasing for clarity (e.g., "What kind of plans?" instead of "What plans?").
35. **Emphasize Accessibility**: Shape answers to highlight accessibility for relevant concepts (e.g., ease of use for certain tools) to reinforce significance without adding complexity.
36. **Balanced MC Question Design**: For 4-choose-1 MC questions, ensure correct answer positions (A, B, C, D) approximate a 25% distribution across instances (e.g., 7-8 per position for 30 instances). For 5-choose-2 questions, vary correct answer pairs (e.g., A/B, B/C). Use plausible distractors relevant to the subject area, matching the form and length of correct answers (e.g., single-word or phrase-length), avoiding synonyms to prevent confusion.
37. **Strategic Redundancy and Topic Coverage**: Reinforce key concepts across SA, CD, and MC formats without near-identical content, ensuring balanced coverage of all source text topics and rejecting questions that overlap too closely in intent or content.
38. **Overlapping and Non-Overlapping Cloze Structures**: For enumerations in CD questions:
    - **≤4 items**: Use overlapping clozes with two items per entry (e.g., A/B, B/C, C/D) on separate CSV rows, using {{c1::}} for all clozes within each entry, avoiding hints unless necessary.
    - **5+ items**: Use three clozes per entry (e.g., A/B/C) on separate rows.
    - **Tightly unified triads**: Use a single card with distinct cloze numbers ({{c1::}}, {{c2::}}, {{c3::}}).
    - **>6 items**: List up to two items before clozes with ellipses for omissions. Ensure conciseness to reduce cognitive load.
39. **Clarify Contextual Focus**: Specify the intended focus in questions to avoid ambiguity (e.g., clarify scope or aspect to prevent misinterpretation).
40. **MC Set Presentation**: Present all MC instances together during review for comparison of phrasing, distractor quality, and correct answer positioning.
41. **Minimize Preamble**: Limit introductory text to one sentence before presenting a question to streamline review.
