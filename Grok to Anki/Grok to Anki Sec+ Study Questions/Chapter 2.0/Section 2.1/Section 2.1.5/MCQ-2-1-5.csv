"[Cybersecurity] Which technical approach method involves an attacker using a tool to identify open ports or detect active devices on a network?","[Cybersecurity] Which technical approach methods involve an attacker using a tool to identify open ports or detect active devices on a network?","Port scan","Phishing||Password cracking||Pretexting||Spyware","Port scan identifies open ports to find vulnerabilities, a technical approach method per Section 2.1.5.||Phishing manipulates users for information, a social engineering tactic.||Password cracking guesses credentials, not specific to port or device detection.||Pretexting uses false scenarios, a social engineering tactic.||Spyware monitors user activity, unrelated to network scanning.<hr>Rationale: Tests recognition of port scan as a technical approach method in a scenario, using distractors from non-technical and unrelated technical methods to reinforce differentiation.","Single-correct","","","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity technical-approach attack-strategy multiple-choice"
"[Cybersecurity] Which technical approach method involves an attacker sending packets to detect active devices on a network?","[Cybersecurity] Which technical approach methods involve an attacker sending packets to detect active devices on a network?","Ping sweep","Tailgating||SQL injection||Ransomware||Keylogging","Ping sweep sends packets to detect active network devices, a technical approach method per Section 2.1.5.||Tailgating gains physical access, a social engineering tactic.||SQL injection exploits database vulnerabilities, not device detection.||Ransomware locks files, unrelated to network scanning.||Keylogging captures keystrokes, unrelated to device detection.<hr>Rationale: Tests recognition of ping sweep as a technical approach method in a scenario, complementing the port scan question with distractors from non-technical and unrelated technical methods.","Single-correct","","","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity technical-approach attack-strategy multiple-choice"
"[Cybersecurity] Which attack strategy involves exploiting known weaknesses in software or systems?","[Cybersecurity] Which attack strategies involve exploiting known weaknesses in software or systems?","Exploit vulnerabilities","Social engineering||Reconnaissance||Backdoor creation||Privilege escalation","Exploit vulnerabilities takes advantage of known weaknesses in software or systems to steal information, deny services, crash systems, or modify data, per Section 2.1.5.||Social engineering manipulates users.||Reconnaissance gathers information.||Backdoor creation enables alternative access.||Privilege escalation gains higher access rights, not directly exploiting software weaknesses.<hr>Rationale: Tests recognition of exploiting vulnerabilities as an attack strategy, using distractors from other attack strategies to reinforce differentiation.","Single-correct","","","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity exploit-vulnerabilities attack-strategy multiple-choice"
"[Cybersecurity] Which defense methodology involves granting only necessary access for tasks?","[Cybersecurity] Which defense methodologies involve granting only necessary access for tasks?","Principle of least privilege","Defense in depth||Randomness||Simplicity||Variety","The principle of least privilege grants users only the access needed for their tasks, per Section 2.1.5.||Defense in depth uses multiple security layers.||Randomness changes habits to avoid predictability.||Simplicity ensures easy-to-use measures.||Variety uses diverse methods, not focused on minimal access.<hr>Rationale: Tests recognition of the principle of least privilege in a scenario, using distractors from other defense methodologies to reinforce differentiation.","Single-correct","","","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity least-privilege defense-methodology multiple-choice"
