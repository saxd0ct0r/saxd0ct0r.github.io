"[Cybersecurity] Social engineering uses {{c1::intimidation::tactic}} and {{c2::sympathy::tactic}} to manipulate others into providing sensitive information.","Psychological manipulation tactics.<hr>Rationale: Tests recall of the two key social engineering tactics (intimidation and sympathy) as a fixed list from Section 2.1.5, using multiple clozes with part-of-speech hints to reinforce interconnected components. The enumerated tactics are exhaustive per the source text, ensuring clarity for learners.<br>Metadata: Multiple-cloze<br>Source: Section::2.1.5","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity social-engineering attack-strategy cloze enumerative"
"[Cybersecurity] A backdoor allows {{c1::alternative access::method}} to an application or operating system for {{c2::troubleshooting::purpose}}, often exploited by attackers.","Unauthorized system entry.<hr>Rationale: Tests recall of the definition and purpose of a backdoor as atomic facts, using two clozes with part-of-speech hints to clarify distinct components, per Addendum Statement 18. The question reinforces the attack strategy’s dual use (legitimate and malicious) from Section 2.1.5.<br>Metadata: Multiple-cloze<br>Source: Section::2.1.5","Section::2.1.5 cybersecurity backdoor attack-strategy cloze"
"[Cybersecurity] Exploiting vulnerabilities can lead to {{c1::stealing information::action}}, {{c1::denying services::action}}, crashing systems, or modifying information.","Outcomes of vulnerability exploitation.<hr>Rationale: Tests recall of the first two outcomes (stealing information, denying services) of the fixed four-item list, using overlapping clozes with c1 tags to obscure both elements simultaneously, per Addendum Statement 19 for ≤4 items.
