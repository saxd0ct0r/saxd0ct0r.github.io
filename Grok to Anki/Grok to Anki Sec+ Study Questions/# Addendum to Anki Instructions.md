# Addendum to Anki Instructions

This addendum provides additional guidance to supplement the rules in `anki-instructions.txt` for creating Anki-compatible study questions for the CompTIA Security+ exam, based on iterative feedback and refinements. Version 2 integrates original statements with new and consolidated statements added based on feedback.

1. **Atomic SA Answers**: Ensure Simple Answer (SA) answers focus on one atomic fact (e.g., “Handles incident response” for CIRT role), simplifying complex answers by moving additional details to new SA or CD questions, using only details explicitly in the source text.
2. **Avoid Course-Specific Terms in Questions**: Ensure question text excludes course-specific terms (e.g., “CompTIA Security+” or TestOut’s “security simulator”) for reusability, including them only in metadata or explanations, unless they are general cybersecurity concepts.
3. **Multiple-Cloze Formats**: Use multiple-cloze structures with part-of-speech hints (e.g., {{c1::term::verb}}) for complex phrases to enhance granular recall.
4. **Structured Formatting for Questions**: Ensure tags include Section::X.X, topic (e.g., cia), question type (e.g., cloze), and instance number for Multiple Choice (MC) questions (e.g., instance-1), with “multiple-correct” for multiple-correct MC questions; assign letter identifiers (A, B, C, D) to match randomized option order in MC “Options” and “OptionsWithCorrect” columns.
5. **Cross-Reference Prior Conversations**: Check prior conversations, not just previous sections, for duplication, particularly for terms like "availability."
6. **Consistent Cloze Numbering in CD Questions**: Ensure Cloze Deletion (CD) questions use multiple-cloze structures with contextual hints (e.g., {{c1::term::domain}}) for complex phrases, the same cloze number (e.g., {{c1::…}}) for enumerations to cue set size (e.g., CIA triad components), and unique cloze numbers (e.g., {{c1::}}, {{c2::}}) for individual component recall.
7. **Uniform Question Phrasing for MC Instances**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) questions for a topic use identical phrasing across instances, varying only QID and options, to prevent phrasing-based cues; use plural phrasing (e.g., “Which are security control categories?”) for multiple-correct questions and singular (e.g., “Which is a security control category?”) for single-correct questions as an exception.
8. **Vary MC Correct Answer Positions**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) questions use unique, non-consecutive correct answer positions across instances to prevent pattern cues, allowing consecutive positions sparingly for multiple-correct questions.
9. **Robust Non-Circular MC Explanations**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) explanations are robust, avoid circular reasoning (e.g., “CIA triad is correct because it is the CIA triad”), and detail why correct and incorrect options apply, referencing their relevance (e.g., “Confidentiality ensures data access only for authorized users”).
10. **Consistent Form for MC Distractors**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) distractors match the form (single-word or phrase-length) and number (singular, plural, collective) of correct options, shaping correct options to short phrases if single-word distractors are implausible, while being cybersecurity-related and plausible without overlapping correct answers.
11. **Vary Option Counts in MC Questions**: Ensure Multiple Choice (MC) questions primarily use four options with one correct answer, infrequently five options with two correct answers, and rarely seven options with three correct answers for triadic concepts (e.g., CIA triad).
12. **Consistent Option Length in MC Questions**: Ensure all Multiple Choice (MC) options, correct and distractors, have consistent length (phrase-length preferred); shape correct options to short phrases if single-word distractors are implausible, and vice versa, to avoid semantic tells (e.g., “Technical safeguard measures” instead of “Technical”).
13. **Consistent MC Terminology**: Ensure consistent terminology for concepts across Multiple Choice (MC) instances (e.g., “Physical access restriction systems” for Physical controls) to avoid confusion.
14. **Strategic Redundancy Across Formats**: Ensure questions reinforce the same concept across SA, CD, and MC formats (e.g., SOC role as SA fact, CD term, and MC selection) to enhance retention without exact duplication.
15. **Overlapping Cloze for Enumerations**: Ensure Cloze Deletion (CD) conversions of enumerative SA questions use an overlapping structure, preferring three items clozed per entry, but two for four-element lists (e.g., A/B, B/C, C/D for IT, HR, legal, marketing) to balance cognitive load and reinforce repetition.
16. **Separate Rows for Overlapping Cloze Entries**: Ensure overlapping cloze questions place each entry on a separate CSV row to create individual Anki cards, testing enumeration subsets (e.g., A/B, B/C, C/D) for incremental learning.
