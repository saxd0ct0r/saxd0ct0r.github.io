# Grok to Anki Pipeline
The purpose of this project is to develop resources to support using Grok (or any AI) to generate high-quality study questions suitable for reviewing with Anki or similar flashcard programs.

## Files:

`anki-instructions.txt` encapsulates "20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge"

`Addendum_to_Anki_Instructions.markdown` iterative evolution of my feedback to Grok to improve the quality of the questions

`Study Question Instruction Statement` Overall instruction statement that prompts Grok to ingest the text, consult `anki-...` and `Addendum...` files, generate the questions, present the questions one at a time for review, and finally summarize the feedback you give it to iterate the `Addendum...` file.


This project is my attempt to get Grok to generate high-quality study questions from any text I give it. It uses the Project feature of Grok, but I am certain that other LLMs should be able to use these instructions. Over time, the instructions became unwieldy and exceeded the character limit for Grok, so I ended up dividing the instructions into three parts, the project instruction statement, a separate text file with an adaptation of the twenty rules for formulating knowledge by Dr. Piotr Wozniak, and an addendum in Markdown format containing further refinements.

## Project Instruction statement

This statement lies at the heart of the project in the Project Instructions field. In the fashion of prompt engineering, it defines the role Grok plays, what the goal of the project is (in a very general sense), what to expect for inputs, and what the desired outputs will look like. Because the process is highly interactive, the statement also provides a script for the flow of the interaction. Basically, everything starts with 'ingesting' a text, usually with the paperclip 'Attach' button in the prompt window. Usually, I paste what is in the clipboard into the 'Add text' box. Next, Grok analyzes the text and produces an appropriate number of questions, guided by reference to the two files mentioned. It presents one question at a time and awaits feedback. I then either offer guidance to refine the question, accept, or reject the question, at which point I instruct it to move on to the next one. When all the questions have been reviewed, Grok produces three CSV files, one for Simple Answer questions, one for Cloze Deletion questions, and one for Multiple Choice questions. It also compiles all the feedback I have given it over the course of the review, synthesizes additional instruction statements, and appends them to the Addendum file. It is this iterative process that has led to it producing fairly high-quality questions that now require minimal guidance from me.

### 20 Rules for Formulating Knowledge

The file anki-instructions.txt contains instruction statements generated by Grok to encapsulate details of the output requirements for three types of questions, and the document "20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge" by Dr. Piotr Wozniak (https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge). The three types of questions are Simple Answer, which uses the Basic template provided with Anki by default; Cloze Deletion, using the Cloze default template; and Multiple Choice, which uses a custom template, which I will include in my GitHub repo. I should note that the MC definition in this file has been superseded by an improved template that has a number of cool dynamic features.

### Addendum to Instructions

As mentioned above, after reviewing a batch of questions, Grok will gather up all the feedback, synthesize the lessons learned into additional instruction statements, and harmonize them with all the previous lessons learned. I then download this new markdown file, delete the old one, and upload the new iteration. Every so often, I have Grok review the entire list to find ways of consolidating the statements.

## Why it should exist

I am currently studying Cybersecurity, preparing to take the CompTIA Security+ and CySA+ exams. In the past, I found some extensive Anki decks that were very helpful in preparing for the exam. However, in that search, I also saw many decks that had very poorly structured questions, and I found myself avoiding those decks because trying to study with them became almost painful. One of my fellow students had used ChatGPT to generate a practice exam for a different cert, so I decided to give it a try, but as a study in Active Recall. I have many more exams and certifications to study for, and I want to ensure my learning will be durable, not just something I cram for the exam and dump the next day. As I have been working on checking the questions, though, I have found that the preparing of the questions is valuable as a necessary first step to understanding. My hope is that, with further reinforcement through feedback, Grok (or any AI) will become fluent in generating well-structured questions efficiently to accelerate learning any topic.

## This is a work in progress

Because of the iterative nature of the feedback, I expect I will consider this a work in progress for some time. However, that being said, I am seeing the process become more refined each time, requiring fewer nudges with each iteration. Eventually, the prompt and instruction statements will converge into a more or less final form.
