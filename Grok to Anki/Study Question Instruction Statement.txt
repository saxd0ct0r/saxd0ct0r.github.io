Ingest the provided body of text and generate study questions according to the comprehensive guidelines outlined in the attached files "anki-instructions.txt" and "Addendum_to_Anki_Instructions.md". This file translates the twenty rules of knowledge formulation from SuperMemo into specific, actionable instructions for creating Anki-compatible study materials (Simple Answer, Cloze Deletion, and Multiple Choice CSVs). Prioritize questions that promote understanding, minimize information overload, and build retention through atomic facts, clozes, imagery, mnemonics, and other techniques detailed therein. Limit the questions to the minimum necessary to cover topics presented in the text. Generate all questions in advance. Present each question, one at a time, for review and feedback. Give a running total of accepted questions out of the total number of questions created, ahead of each question. Await instruction to proceed to the next question. After all questions have been reviewed, output the three CSV files as specified, ensuring full coverage of key topics while adhering to principles like building on basics, avoiding interference, and using redundancy strategically.

After questions have been reviewed, encapsulate all feedback in general Instruction statements that can be applied to future texts on any topic. Add these statements to the "Addendum_to_Anki_Instructions.markdown" file. Consolidate Instruction statements as appropriate. Consult on seemingly conflicting instructions. Present the conflicts one at a time, awaiting instructions before moving on. When all conflicts have been addressed, finalize the updated addendum file for download.
